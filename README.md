Anemia Detection & Prevention using Machine Learing and Web Development

According to estimates by the World Health Organization, around 25% of the global population suffers from anemia—that is, roughly one in four people. 
The prevalence, however, is not uniform across all groups and regions. For instance:

- **Pregnant Women:** The prevalence can be higher, often ranging between 29% to 38% depending on the region.

- **Children (especially preschool-aged):** Some regions report rates as high as 42%.

These variations depend on factors like nutritional status, healthcare access, and socioeconomic conditions.
so I created an unique model using RandomForestClassifier providing us an accuracy of 98.50%   

RandomForest classifiers are often preferred for health monitoring for several key reasons:
1) Robustness Through Ensemble Learning
2) Handling Complex and High-Dimensional Data
3) Feature Importance Insights
4) Robustness Against Missing Data
5) Ease of Use and Versatility

RandomForest generally requires less parameter tuning and is user-friendly, making it a practical choice for various health monitoring applications—from disease prediction to patient risk assessment.
While no single model is universally the best, RandomForest’s balance of accuracy, interpretability, and robustness makes it a strong candidate for many health monitoring tasks.

STEPS OF DEPLOYMENT - 

Further I created a Web Application by using Streamlit App which provides me with URL, Streamlit makes my work easier than ever.

To improve authenticity, I refered Hb levels from WHO site:

WHO Hemoglobin (Hb) ranges for Normal, Mild, Moderate, and Severe Anemia:

Normal Hb Ranges (WHO Guidelines)- 

Men: 13.0 – 17.0 g/dL,
Women (Non-Pregnant): 12.0 – 15.0 g/dL,
Children (6 months – 5 years): 11.0 – 14.0 g/dL,
Children (5–12 years): 11.5 – 15.0 g/dL,
Adolescents (12–15 years): 12.0 – 16.0 g/dL,
Pregnant Women: 11.0 – 14.0 g/dL.

Anemia Classification (WHO Criteria) 

For Men - 
Mild Anemia: 11.0 – 12.9 g/dL,
Moderate Anemia: 8.0 – 10.9 g/dL,
Severe Anemia: < 8.0 g/dL.

For Women (Non-Pregnant) - 
Mild Anemia: 11.0 – 11.9 g/dL,
Moderate Anemia: 8.0 – 10.9 g/dL,
Severe Anemia: < 8.0 g/dL.

For Pregnant Women - 
Mild Anemia: 10.0 – 10.9 g/dL,
Moderate Anemia: 7.0 – 9.9 g/dL,
Severe Anemia: < 7.0 g/dL.

For Children (6 months – 5 years) - 
Mild Anemia: 10.0 – 10.9 g/dL,
Moderate Anemia: 7.0 – 9.9 g/dL,
Severe Anemia: < 7.0 g/dL.

For Children (5–12 years) - 
Mild Anemia: 11.0 – 11.4 g/dL,
Moderate Anemia: 8.0 – 10.9 g/dL,
Severe Anemia: < 8.0 g/dL.
